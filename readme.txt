== Description ==

Plugin add the `Copy` button within the `<pre>` tag and it copy the content of `<pre>` tag into the clipboard.

= 1. How it Works? =

Simply, It search the `<pre>` tag within the page and add the `Copy` button within it.

= 2. It add `Copy` button for each `&lt;pre&gt;` tag? =

Yes, Once you activate the plugin it add search the `<pre>` tag and add the `Copy` button in it.

= 3. Can I use another selector instead of `&lt;pre&gt;` tag? =

Yes, You can change the selector though filter `copy_the_code_localize_vars`.

Eg. If you want to enable the `Copy` button for only single page, post etc. Then You can change the selector `body.single pre` though filter.

<pre>
add_filter( 'copy_the_code_localize_vars', 'my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars' );
function my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars( $defaults )
{
	// `single class is added to the `<body>` tag for the single page, post etc.
	$defaults['selector'] = 'body.single pre';

	return $defaults;	
}
</pre>
